                    <h2>Biography</h2>
                    <p>Before the age of 30, I achieved my goal of becoming an Assistant Professor in China's top psychology department. However, due to changes in my family plan, I began a new journey in Germany.
                    <br>Despite working on data projects such as PISA and NEPS and publishing over 20 peer-reviewed journal papers (google h-index 11), balancing life as a mother of two and striving for a permanent position in Germany was still challenging. 
                    This led me to a career as a UX professional with Huawei and BMW. Throughout this journey, I've learned invaluable lessons and experienced things I wouldn't have seen had I taken a different path. </p>
