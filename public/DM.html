                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project was part of my PhD project. The goals of this project was to evaluate the interaction objects for the Nano-Tech exhibition and investigate the learning effect of them on 
                    different visitors who have different motivation profiles, outcomes included variables such as their experience interacting with objects and their appraisals.</p>

                        <h3>Background and goals</h3>
                        <p>This is a collaborative project with Deutsches Museum. We aimed at evaluating the effect of the interactive objects of the new Nano-Tech exhibition on visitors' experience. 
                            Object-relevant factors as well as individual factors such as motivational profile were considered and outcomes such as interaction behavior, appraisals were treated as evaluation criteria. As part of my PhD study, the project lasted for less as 1 year. Within the time several qualitative studies as well as two quantitative studies were conducted thanks to help from museum staffs and support from university.</p>

                        <h3>Approaches and Methods</h3>
                        <p>Evaluation of the interactive objects of the NANO-Tech exhibition based on cognitive load theory (CLT), including perspectives from visitors and experts. Some object design did not align with principles in CLT (such as modality /split attention and redundancy principles) which can be optimized 
                            Evaluation varied among visitors with different background. They came to the museum with different goals and profiles (learning, social and hedonic goals) and their interaction  experience as well as appraisals depended on such motivation/profiles. Results indicated the value of providing personalized object interaction

                        <p>Research results have contributed to the knowledge about interactive objects in DM and individual differences/ customer segmentation 
                            potential impact on promoting museum innovation, personalized informal learning and visitor engagement.
