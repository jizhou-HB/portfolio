                    <p>Our team at HW Munich Research Center focused on developing innovative Human-Machine Interface (HMI) solutions for intelligent car pilots using future technologies. 
                        So generally we would like to find some solutions for current pain-points using Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in cars. Specifically, we would like to know: </p>

                            <li>Market analysis and benchmarking: We conducted competitive analysis to analyze the features and solutions of key competitors. After that strengths and weaknesses of competitors, as well as opportunities for our product were identified.</li>
                            <li>Literature and patent search: By summarizing insights from literature (e.g., IEEE conferences and journals) and patents (Google Patents, internal databases), we were able to know trends and limitations of technology, have also collected info about relevant theories, design principles, and specific findings. </li>
                            <li>User car forums, past datasets, and empirical studies: By analyzing car test videos in natural contexts and summarizing findings from similar qualitative studies, we were able to identify key use cases, user journey and pain-points, and possible individual factors that might influence experience</li>

                    <h3>Approaches</h3>
                    <p>A video-based interview was used for the research aim. We had some meetings with our designers and developer in order to communicate about the specifications of event video clips. After that we have constructed our interview schema based on our goals. We tried to maximize the ecological validity of our research and allowed the participants to go through the event in a (quasi-)naturalistic context, so that we can collect some real responses and behaviors. Post-event interview was designed to collect subjective data about thoughts and reasons for some user responses. Altogether data from 12 participants were collected during 2 weeks.</p>
